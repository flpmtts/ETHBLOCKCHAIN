ETH Blockchain Project
This repository contains an Ethereum blockchain project that demonstrates the development and interaction with smart contracts on the Ethereum network. The project includes various tools, configurations, and scripts to help developers set up a local Ethereum environment and interact with smart contracts.

Key Features:
Smart Contract Development: Includes example smart contracts written in Solidity.
Local Blockchain Setup: Provides configurations for setting up a local Ethereum blockchain environment using tools like Geth or Ganache.
Interacting with Contracts: Scripts and examples are provided for deploying and interacting with smart contracts using tools like Truffle or Hardhat.
Test Suite: Includes unit tests to verify the functionality of smart contracts, using testing frameworks such as Mocha and Chai.
Token Contracts: Example ERC20 token contracts are included, demonstrating how to create and manage custom tokens.

Requirements:
Node.js and npm installed.
Geth, Ganache, or Hardhat installed for local blockchain development.
Solidity Compiler for smart contract compilation.
